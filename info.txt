for user authentication using flask-jwt
->we can use sessions to manage users in case of web but we can't handle them in case of mobile app
for such thing we are using token based authentication 
such that every logged in user gets token so that we can uniquely identify which user it is depending on token send to us
-> before we used to maintain some table to save tokens which used to make us lifting heavier
but jwt has made liftng easy by giving us a token and secret key , we can decode the user by using respective
secret key for tokens and keep the users active in sessions.
--> install using : pip install flask-jwt-extended

-->heroku deployment 
1. first install gunicorn
